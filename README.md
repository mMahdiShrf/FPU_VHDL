## Introduction
FPUs are essential for many types of processors and significantly reduce the time needed for processing floating-point arithmetic. In this project, we designed and developed a module that can turn an FPGA IC into an external FPU.

## Features
- Supporting basic mathematical operations for numbers that obey IEEE 754 standards
- Modular design
- Clock input to synchronize processing speed

## Software Requirements
- ISE 14.7 to synthesize on FPGA

## Usage
- Using FPGA as external FPU

## VHDL Development
- [Describe the structure of the VHDL code, key modules, and any specific coding standards or guidelines followed. Include information about the design approach and methodologies used.]
